No business can survive in this competitive market without managing their cost. It does not matter if revenues are high but if cost is higher it is a red flag. So you are tasked to 
help management in creating and establishing new structure and models to reduce cost. Do ETL : Extract-Transform-Load the dataset and find for me some information from this large data. 
This is form of data mining. The dataset as listed on NITI Aayog website from 1980_81 to 2015_16 What all information can be achieved by mining this data, would be brainstormed by the interns. 
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings.

The dataset comprised multiple files detailing state expenditures over several years. My primary objective was to apply my data analysis skills to extract meaningful 
insights from this extensive information. To achieve this, I wrote approximately 200 lines of Python code utilizing libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
