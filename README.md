<h2><b>Problem statement</b></h2>

No business can survive in this competitive market without managing their cost. It does not matter if revenues are high but if cost is higher it is a red flag. So you are tasked to 
help management in creating and establishing new structure and models to reduce cost. Do ETL : Extract-Transform-Load the dataset and find for me some information from this large data. 
This is form of data mining. The dataset as listed on NITI Aayog website from 1980_81 to 2015_16 What all information can be achieved by mining this data, would be brainstormed by the interns. 
Find key metrics and factors and show the meaningful relationships between attributes. Do your own research and come up with your findings.

<h2><b>Dataset</b></h2>

You can find the dataset on the given link 
<a href: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FkmFVL8wlJmQWP1z52TD8PlhOJhitTyI?usp

<h2><b>What did the dataset have?</h2></b>

The dataset comprised multiple files detailing state expenditures over several years. My primary objective was to apply my data analysis skills to extract meaningful insights from this extensive 
information. 

To achieve this, I wrote approximately 200 lines of Python code utilizing libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.


<h2><b>Introduction</b></h2>

In the <b>Expenditure Data Analysis Project</b>, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset provided by Niti Aayog, focusing on the expenditure of various Indian states. 
The project involved several critical steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

I used python libraries to get expenditure information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally I worked at a few ways of analyzing the spending of expenditure based on its previous 
performance history statewise in India.  To make prediction and better decision.

An <b>Expenditure Data Analysis</b> is the project related to <b>Exploratory data analysis(EDA)</b> and Data visualization of expenditure dataset from NITI Aayog of India. I used python libraries to get 
expenditure information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally I worked at a few ways of analyzing the spending of expenditure based on its previous performance history statewise in India. 
First extract dataset given above, prepared data, clean ,load and transform into Power BI desktop Then creating an interactive insightful dashboard and publish on novypro. To make prediction and better 
decision.

<h2><b>Acknowledgements</b></h2>

I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to all the trainers and the iNeuron team for their invaluable support and guidance throughout the Expenditure Data Analysis Project. Their expertise and encouragement were instrumental in enhancing my data analysis skills and ensuring the successful completion of this project. I truly appreciate the collaborative environment fostered by the iNeuron team, which significantly contributed to my learning experience. Thank you for being an essential part of this journey.
