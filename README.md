# Expenditure-Data-Analytics--

In the Expenditure Data Analysis Project, I undertook a comprehensive analysis of a large dataset provided by Niti Aayog, focusing on the expenditure of various Indian states. 
The project involved several critical steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization.

The dataset comprised multiple files detailing state expenditures over several years. My primary objective was to apply my data analysis skills to extract meaningful 
insights from this extensive information. To achieve this, I wrote approximately 200 lines of Python code utilizing libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
