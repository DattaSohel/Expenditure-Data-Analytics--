<h1><b>Below is a description of the various graphs generated by the code for the Expenditure Data Analysis Project:</b></h1>

<h2>Graph Descriptions</h2>

<ol>
  <h3><li><b> Heatmap of Missing Values:</b></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Description:</b> This heatmap visually represents the presence of missing values in the dataset. Each cell corresponds to a data point, with colors indicating whether the value is present 
      (light color) or missing (dark color). This visualization helps identify patterns of missing data across different columns.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3><li><b> Histograms of Numeric Columns:</b></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Description:</b> This set of histograms displays the distribution of numeric variables in the dataset. Each histogram provides insights into the frequency distribution of values for each numeric column, helping to identify skewness, outliers, and general trends in expenditure data.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3><li><b> Countplots for Categorical Variables: </b></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Description:</b> Countplots are generated for each categorical variable in the dataset, such as "Exp Category" and "State." These plots show the number of occurrences for each category, providing a clear visual representation of how expenditures are distributed across different categories and states.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3><li><b> Correlation Heatmap:</b></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Description:</b> The correlation heatmap illustrates the relationships between numeric variables in the dataset. Each cell shows the correlation coefficient between pairs of variables, with colors indicating the strength and direction of the correlation. This helps identify which factors are positively or negatively related to expenditure.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3><li><b> Countplot for Expenditure Categories: </li></b></li>
  <ul>
  <li><b>Description:</b> This specific countplot focuses on the "Exp Category" variable, showing how many expenditures fall into each category. It provides a quick overview of which categories are most prevalent in the dataset.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3><li><b> Countplot for Expenditure by State: </b></li></h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Description:</b> Similar to the expenditure category countplot, this visualization displays the distribution of total expenditures across different states. It highlights which states have higher or lower expenditure levels.</li>
  </ul>
